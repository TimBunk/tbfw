## About tbfw

tbfw is my first 3D framework that is using openGL. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good.

## Compiling

You can use cmake to create the project files.

I have only tested my framework on visual studio 2015 on a windows machine, so if you are using something else it might or might not work for you.

## Documentation

Documentation will be added soon using doxygen.
